# Space-Invaders-biuoop-1.4.jar
Space Invaders game using the Bar-Illan University biuoop jar file.
This is exactly what the title says.
Only thing different from the original space invaders game is that the
aliens go down a columm at a time, and not all of them together.
I do not intend to change this.
Future students of Bar-Illan, feel free to use this project as an example.
